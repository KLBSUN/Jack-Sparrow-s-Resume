  <h1>My Contact Details</h1>
  <p>Ahoy there!</p>
  <p>Contacting Captain Jack Sparrow is no simple task, mate. He's a swashbuckling pirate who's always on the move, sailing across the seven seas. However, I have some suggestions that might tickle your fancy:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Bottle Message:</b> Write a note and place it in a bottle. Toss it into the sea and hope it reaches the shores of whatever deserted island Jack's marooned on at the moment. Be sure to include something shiny to catch his eye!</li>
    <li><b>Rum Trail:</b> Create a trail of rum bottles leading to your location. It's common knowledge that Jack has a soft spot for rum, and he might just follow the trail right to your doorstep.</li>
    <li><b>Pirate Radio:</b> Get on the airwaves of the pirate radio and send out a message. Include a riddle or a map for that added pirate-y touch. Jack Sparrow loves a good adventure, and he might just show up to solve your cryptic call.</li>
    <li><b>Enlist a Parrot:</b> Find a savvy parrot, teach it your message, and send it flying. With luck, the parrot will squawk its way to Jack's shoulder and deliver your message.</li>
    <li><b>Summon the Black Pearl:</b> If all else fails, find a way to summon the Black Pearl. It's said that the ship can be called from the depths of the sea. Once on board, you'll surely run into Captain Jack Sparrow, probably in the midst of some shenanigans.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Remember, patience is key. Jack Sparrow operates on pirate time, which by nature is unpredictable. So while you wait, why not enjoy a pirate's life yourself? Grab a bottle of rum, don a tricorn hat, and practice your sea shanties.</p>
